        ⠀The original Bhairawa statue is still preserved in the Leiden Museum, in the Netherlands. This beautiful but scary statue is rarely known by people. This statue was discovered by Engelhard in 1827, together with several other statues, this statue is one of the frightening manifestations of the God Shiva and is called Bhairawa. Standing on a pile of skull heads and with a slightly squatting attitude, he was like sitting on the back of a wolf. He has 4 hands, each of which holds a keris, a short spear, a drum and a skull. On his body, hung a long necklace decorated with a skull head, as well as earrings and jewelries on his left and right upper arms. His face bulged and his mouth slightly opened to reveal his fangs. It is strongly suspected that this statue was once located in one of the temples to the south of Singosari temple, which has now lost its trace.
