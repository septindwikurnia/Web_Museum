Singhasari Museum is managed by the Department of Tourism and Culture of Malang Regency which is a social and non-profit institution. Its main activity focuses on the history of Singosari District from the classical period (Singhasari Kingdom) to the present with a vision of establishing the Singhasari Museum as a Center for the Study of Singhasari.

The Singhasari Museum was built on the initiative of the Singhasari Residence owner in collaboration with the Malang Regency Government, which was inaugurated by the Malang Regent (H. Rendra Kresna) on May 20th, 2015. This museum was established as a form of concern not to forget the history of the Singhasari Kingdom which is believed to be the forerunner of the next major kingdoms such as Majapahit, Demak, Pajang, and even Mataram which are still closely related to the Singhasari kingdom.

On this basis, a storefront is needed to provide information about Singhasari from a cultural, historical, social, tourism and other useful information for the wider community. The storefront is manifested in the form of the Singhasari Museum. It is hard work that requires a lot of time, effort and money in an effort to realize the vision of the Singhasari Museum as a Center for Study of Singhasari and it takes the support of all parties to make the Singhasari Museum a representative and worthy museum.

Today the museum complex has become one of the tourist attractions with the hope that the Singhasari Museum will be increasingly popular, advanced, and able to provide many benefits for all circles.
